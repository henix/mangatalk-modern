This project is built upon the [Roots Starter Theme framework.](https://roots.io) 

Caution: as of early 2015, the classic Roots Starter Theme has become deprecated in favor of Sage (a major upgrade & rebranding). This project has *not* been updated to Sage yet. You could find the classic Roots repository [here.](https://github.com/roots/roots-sass/tree/ef0854d7602f76edd809b7dac448c2ba48fe9357)

This project uses [Sass](http://sass-lang.com) with Compass as the CSS compiler. Ruby, Sass and Compass must be installed prior to deployment. You may refer to [Sass' official guide](http://sass-lang.com/install) for installation.
